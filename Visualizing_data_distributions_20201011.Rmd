# **Chapter 8 Visualizing data distributions**

You may have noticed that numerical data is often summarized with the <em>average value</em>. For example, the quality of a high school is sometimes summarized with one number: the average score on a standardized test. Occasionally, a second number is reported: the <em>standard deviation</em>. For example, you might read a report stating that scores were 680 plus or minus 50 (the standard deviation). The report has summarized an entire vector of scores with just two numbers. Is this appropriate? Is there any important piece of information that we are missing by only looking at this summary rather than the entire list?

Our first data visualization building block is learning to summarize lists of factors or numeric vectors. More often than not, the best way to share or explore this summary is through data visualization. The most basic statistical summary of a list of objects or numbers is its distribution. Once a vector has been summarized as a distribution, there are several data visualization techniques to effectively relay this information.

In this chapter, we first discuss properties of a variety of distributions and how to visualize distributions using a motivating example of student heights. We then discuss the **ggplot2** geometries for these visualizations in Section [8.16](https://rafalab.github.io/dsbook/distributions.html#other-geometries).

## **8.1 Variable types**

We will be working with two types of variables: categorical and numeric. Each can be divided into two other groups: categorical can be ordinal or not, whereas numerical variables can be discrete or continuous.

When each entry in a vector comes from one of a small number of groups, we refer to the data as <em>categorical data</em>. Two simple examples are sex (male or female) and regions (Northeast, South, North Central, West). Some categorical data can be ordered even if they are not numbers per se, such as spiciness (mild, medium, hot). In statistics textbooks, ordered categorical data are referred to as <em>ordinal data</em>.

Examples of numerical data are population sizes, murder rates, and heights. Some numerical data can be treated as ordered categorical. We can further divide numerical data into continuous and discrete. Continuous variables are those that can take any value, such as heights, if measured with enough precision. For example, a pair of twins may be 68.12 and 68.11 inches, respectively. Counts, such as population sizes, are discrete because they have to be round numbers.

Keep in mind that discrete numeric data can be considered ordinal. Although this is technically true, we usually reserve the term ordinal data for variables belonging to a small number of different groups, with each group having many members. In contrast, when we have many groups with few cases in each group, we typically refer to them as discrete numerical variables. So, for example, the number of packs of cigarettes a person smokes a day, rounded to the closest pack, would be considered ordinal, while the actual number of cigarettes would be considered a numerical variable. But, indeed, there are examples that can be considered both numerical and ordinal when it comes to visualizing data.

## **8.2 Case study: describing student height**

Here we introduce a new motivating problem. It is an artificial one, but it will help us illustrate the concepts needed to understand distributions.

Pretend that we have to describe the heights of our classmates to ET, an extraterrestrial that has never seen humans. As a first step, we need to collect data. To do this, we ask students to report their heights in inches. We ask them to provide sex information because we know there are two different distributions by sex. We collect the data and save it in the `heights` data frame:
```{r}
library(tidyverse)
library(dslabs)
data(heights)
```
One way to convey the heights to ET is to simply send him this list of 1050 heights. But there are much more effective ways to convey this information, and understanding the concept of a distribution will help. To simplify the explanation, we first focus on male heights. We examine the female height data in Section [8.14](https://rafalab.github.io/dsbook/distributions.html#student-height-cont).

## **8.3 Distribution function**

It turns out that, in some cases, the average and the standard deviation are pretty much all we need to understand the data. We will learn data visualization techniques that will help us determine when this two number summary is appropriate. These same techniques will serve as an alternative for when two numbers are not enough.

The most basic statistical summary of a list of objects or numbers is its distribution. The simplest way to think of a distribution is as a compact description of a list with many entries. This concept should not be new for readers of this book. For example, with categorical data, the distribution simply describes the proportion of each unique category. The sex represented in the heights dataset is:
```{r}
#> 
#> Female   Male 
#>  0.227  0.773
```
This two-category <em>frequency</em> table is the simplest form of a distribution. We don’t really need to visualize it since one number describes everything we need to know: 23% are females and the rest are males. When there are more categories, then a simple barplot describes the distribution. Here is an example with US state regions:
```{r}
#> `summarise()` ungrouping output (override with `.groups` argument)
```

![](https://rafalab.github.io/dsbook/book_files/figure-html/state-region-distribution-1.png)

This particular plot simply shows us four numbers, one for each category. We usually use barplots to display a few numbers. Although this particular plot does not provide much more insight than a frequency table itself, it is a first example of how we convert a vector into a plot that succinctly summarizes all the information in the vector. When the data is numerical, the task of displaying distributions is more challenging.

## **8.4 Cumulative distribution functions**

Numerical data that are not categorical also have distributions. In general, when data is not categorical, reporting the frequency of each entry is not an effective summary since most entries are unique. In our case study, while several students reported a height of 68 inches, only one student reported a height of `68.503937007874` inches and only one student reported a height `68.8976377952756` inches. We assume that they converted from 174 and 175 centimeters, respectively.

Statistics textbooks teach us that a more useful way to define a distribution for numeric data is to define a function that reports the proportion of the data below $a$ for all possible values of $a$. This function is called the cumulative distribution function (CDF). In statistics, the following notation is used:
$F(a) = \mbox{Pr}(x \leq a)$
Here is a plot of $F$ for the male height data:

![](https://rafalab.github.io/dsbook/book_files/figure-html/ecdf-1.png)

Similar to what the frequency table does for categorical data, the CDF defines the distribution for numerical data. From the plot, we can see that 16% of the values are below 65, since $F(66)=$0.164, or that 84% of the values are below 72, since $F(72)=$0.841, and so on. In fact, we can report the proportion of values between any two heights, say $a$ and $b$, by computing $F(b) - F(a)$. This means that if we send this plot above to ET, he will have all the information needed to reconstruct the entire list. Paraphrasing the expression “a picture is worth a thousand words”, in this case, a picture is as informative as 812 numbers.

A final note: because CDFs can be defined mathematically the word <em>empirical</em> is added to make the distinction when data is used. We therefore use the term empirical CDF (eCDF).

## **8.5 Histograms**

Although the CDF concept is widely discussed in statistics textbooks, the plot is actually not very popular in practice. The main reason is that it does not easily convey characteristics of interest such as: at what value is the distribution centered? Is the distribution symmetric? What ranges contain 95% of the values? Histograms are much preferred because they greatly facilitate answering such questions. Histograms sacrifice just a bit of information to produce plots that are much easier to interpret.

The simplest way to make a histogram is to divide the span of our data into non-overlapping bins of the same size. Then, for each bin, we count the number of values that fall in that interval. The histogram plots these counts as bars with the base of the bar defined by the intervals. Here is the histogram for the height data splitting the range of values into one inch intervals:
$(49.5, 50.5],(50.5, 51.5],(51.5,52.5],(52.5,53.5],...,(82.5,83.5]$

![](https://rafalab.github.io/dsbook/book_files/figure-html/height-histogram-1.png)

As you can see in the figure above, a histogram is similar to a barplot, but it differs in that the x-axis is numerical, not categorical.

If we send this plot to ET, he will immediately learn some important properties about our data. First, the range of the data is from 50 to 84 with the majority (more than 95%) between 63 and 75 inches. Second, the heights are close to symmetric around 69 inches. Also, by adding up counts, ET could obtain a very good approximation of the proportion of the data in any interval. Therefore, the histogram above is not only easy to interpret, but also provides almost all the information contained in the raw list of 812 heights with about 30 bin counts.

What information do we lose? Note that all values in each interval are treated the same when computing bin heights. So, for example, the histogram does not distinguish between 64, 64.1, and 64.2 inches. Given that these differences are almost unnoticeable to the eye, the practical implications are negligible and we were able to summarize the data to just 23 numbers.

We discuss how to code histograms in Section [8.16](https://rafalab.github.io/dsbook/distributions.html#other-geometries).

## **8.6 Smoothed density**

Smooth density plots are aesthetically more appealing than histograms. Here is what a smooth density plot looks like for our heights data:

![](https://rafalab.github.io/dsbook/book_files/figure-html/example-of-smoothed-density-1.png)

In this plot, we no longer have sharp edges at the interval boundaries and many of the local peaks have been removed. Also, the scale of the y-axis changed from counts to <em>density</em>.

To understand the smooth densities, we have to understand <em>estimates</em>, a topic we don’t cover until later. However, we provide a heuristic explanation to help you understand the basics so you can use this useful data visualization tool.

The main new concept you must understand is that we assume that our list of observed values is a subset of a much larger list of unobserved values. In the case of heights, you can imagine that our list of 812 male students comes from a hypothetical list containing all the heights of all the male students in all the world measured very precisely. Let’s say there are 1,000,000 of these measurements. This list of values has a distribution, like any list of values, and this larger distribution is really what we want to report to ET since it is much more general. Unfortunately, we don’t get to see it.

However, we make an assumption that helps us perhaps approximate it. If we had 1,000,000 values, measured very precisely, we could make a histogram with very, very small bins. The assumption is that if we show this, the height of consecutive bins will be similar. This is what we mean by smooth: we don’t have big jumps in the heights of consecutive bins. Below we have a hypothetical histogram with bins of size 1:

![](https://rafalab.github.io/dsbook/book_files/figure-html/simulated-data-histogram-1-1.png)

The smaller we make the bins, the smoother the histogram gets. Here are the histograms with bin width of 1, 0.5, and 0.1:

![](https://rafalab.github.io/dsbook/book_files/figure-html/simulated-data-histogram-2-1.png)

The smooth density is basically the curve that goes through the top of the histogram bars when the bins are very, very small. To make the curve not depend on the hypothetical size of the hypothetical list, we compute the curve on frequencies rather than counts:

![](https://rafalab.github.io/dsbook/book_files/figure-html/simulated-density-1-1.png)

Now, back to reality. We don’t have millions of measurements. Instead, we have 812 and we can’t make a histogram with very small bins.

We therefore make a histogram, using bin sizes appropriate for our data and computing frequencies rather than counts, and we draw a smooth curve that goes through the tops of the histogram bars. The following plots demonstrate the steps that lead to a smooth density:

![](https://rafalab.github.io/dsbook/book_files/figure-html/smooth-density-2-1.png)

However, remember that <em>smooth</em> is a relative term. We can actually control the <em>smoothness</em> of the curve that defines the smooth density through an option in the function that computes the smooth density curve. Here are two examples using different degrees of smoothness on the same histogram:

![](https://rafalab.github.io/dsbook/book_files/figure-html/densities-different-smoothness-1.png)

We need to make this choice with care as the resulting visualizations can change our interpretation of the data. We should select a degree of smoothness that we can defend as being representative of the underlying data. In the case of height, we really do have reason to believe that the proportion of people with similar heights should be the same. For example, the proportion that is 72 inches should be more similar to the proportion that is 71 than to the proportion that is 78 or 65. This implies that the curve should be pretty smooth; that is, the curve should look more like the example on the right than on the left.

While the histogram is an assumption-free summary, the smoothed density is based on some assumptions.

### **8.6.1 Interpreting the y-axis**

Note that interpreting the y-axis of a smooth density plot is not straightforward. It is scaled so that the area under the density curve adds up to 1. If you imagine we form a bin with a base 1 unit in length, the y-axis value tells us the proportion of values in that bin. However, this is only true for bins of size 1. For other size intervals, the best way to determine the proportion of data in that interval is by computing the proportion of the total area contained in that interval. For example, here are the proportion of values between 65 and 68:

![](https://rafalab.github.io/dsbook/book_files/figure-html/area-under-curve-1.png)

The proportion of this area is about 0.3, meaning that about 30% of male heights are between 65 and 68 inches.

By understanding this, we are ready to use the smooth density as a summary. For this dataset, we would feel quite comfortable with the smoothness assumption, and therefore with sharing this aesthetically pleasing figure with ET, which he could use to understand our male heights data:

![](https://rafalab.github.io/dsbook/book_files/figure-html/example-of-smoothed-density-2-1.png)

### **8.6.2 Densities permit stratification**

As a final note, we point out that an advantage of smooth densities over histograms for visualization purposes is that densities make it easier to compare two distributions. This is in large part because the jagged edges of the histogram add clutter. Here is an example comparing male and female heights:

![](https://rafalab.github.io/dsbook/book_files/figure-html/two-densities-one-plot-1.png)

With the right argument, `ggplot` automatically shades the intersecting region with a different color. We will show examples of **ggplot2** code for densities in Section [9](https://rafalab.github.io/dsbook/gapminder.html#gapminder) as well as Section [8.16](https://rafalab.github.io/dsbook/distributions.html#other-geometries).

## **8.8 The normal distribution**

Histograms and density plots provide excellent summaries of a distribution. But can we summarize even further? We often see the average and standard deviation used as summary statistics: a two-number summary! To understand what these summaries are and why they are so widely used, we need to understand the normal distribution.

The normal distribution, also known as the bell curve and as the Gaussian distribution, is one of the most famous mathematical concepts in history. A reason for this is that approximately normal distributions occur in many situations, including gambling winnings, heights, weights, blood pressure, standardized test scores, and experimental measurement errors. There are explanations for this, but we describe these later. Here we focus on how the normal distribution helps us summarize data.

Rather than using data, the normal distribution is defined with a mathematical formula. For any interval $(a,b)$, the proportion of values in that interval can be computed using this formula:

$\mbox{Pr}(a < x < b) = \int_a^b \frac{1}{\sqrt{2\pi}s} e^{-\frac{1}{2}\left( \frac{x-m}{s} \right)^2} \, dx$

You don’t need to memorize or understand the details of the formula. But note that it is completely defined by just two parameters:$m$ and $s$. The rest of the symbols in the formula represent the interval ends that we determine, $a$ and $b$, and known mathematical constants $π$ and $e$. These two parameters, $m$ and $s$, are referred to as the <em>average</em> (also called the <em>mean</em>) and the standard deviation (SD) of the distribution, respectively.

The distribution is symmetric, centered at the average, and most values (about 95%) are within 2 SDs from the average. Here is what the normal distribution looks like when the average is 0 and the SD is 1:

![](https://rafalab.github.io/dsbook/book_files/figure-html/normal-distribution-density-1.png)

The fact that the distribution is defined by just two parameters implies that if a dataset is approximated by a normal distribution, all the information needed to describe the distribution can be encoded in just two numbers: the average and the standard deviation. We now define these values for an arbitrary list of numbers.

For a list of numbers contained in a vector `x`, the average is defined as:
```{r}
m <- sum(x) / length(x)
```
and the SD is defined as:
```{r}
s <- sqrt(sum((x-mu)^2) / length(x))
```
which can be interpreted as the average distance between values and their average.

Let’s compute the values for the height for males which we will store in the object $x$:
```{r}
index <- heights$sex == "Male"
x <- heights$height[index]
```
The pre-built functions `mean` and `sd` (note that for reasons explained in Section [16.2](https://rafalab.github.io/dsbook/models.html#data-driven-model), `sd` divides by `length(x)-1` rather than `length(x)`) can be used here:
```{r}
m <- mean(x)
s <- sd(x)
c(average = m, sd = s)
```

Here is a plot of the smooth density and the normal distribution with mean = 69.3 and SD = 3.6 plotted as a black line with our student height smooth density in blue:

![](https://rafalab.github.io/dsbook/book_files/figure-html/data-and-normal-densities-1.png)

The normal distribution does appear to be quite a good approximation here. We now will see how well this approximation works at predicting the proportion of values within intervals.

## **8.9 Standard units**

For data that is approximately normally distributed, it is convenient to think in terms of <em>standard units</em>. The standard unit of a value tells us how many standard deviations away from the average it is. Specifically, for a value `x` from a vector `X`, we define the value of `x` in standard units as `z = (x - m)/s` with `m` and `s` the average and standard deviation of `X`, respectively. Why is this convenient?

First look back at the formula for the normal distribution and note that what is being exponentiated is $-z^2/2$ with $z$ equivalent to $x$ in standard units. Because the maximum of $e^{-z^2/2}$ is when $z=0$, this explains why the maximum of the distribution occurs at the average. It also explains the symmetry since $- z^2/2$ is symmetric around 0. Second, note that if we convert the normally distributed data to standard units, we can quickly know if, for example, a person is about average ($z=0$), one of the largest ($z \approx 2$), one of the smallest ($z \approx -2$), or an extremely rare occurrence ($z > 3$ or $x < -3$). Remember that it does not matter what the original units are, these rules apply to any data that is approximately normal.

In R, we can obtain standard units using the function `scale`:
```{r}
z <- scale(x)
```
Now to see how many men are within 2 SDs from the average, we simply type:
```{r}
mean(abs(z) < 2)
```
The proportion is about 95%, which is what the normal distribution predicts! To further confirm that, in fact, the approximation is a good one, we can use quantile-quantile plots.

## **8.10 Quantile-quantile plots**

A systematic way to assess how well the normal distribution fits the data is to check if the observed and predicted proportions match. In general, this is the approach of the quantile-quantile plot (QQ-plot).

First let’s define the theoretical quantiles for the normal distribution. In statistics books we use the symbol $\Phi(x)$ to define the function that gives us the probability of a standard normal distribution being smaller than $x$. So, for example, $\Phi(-1.96) = 0.025$ and $\Phi(1.96) = 0.975$. In R, we can evaluate $\Phi$ using the `pnorm` function:
```{r}
pnorm(-1.96)
```
The inverse function $\Phi^{-1}(x)$ gives us the <em>theoretical quantiles</em> for the normal distribution. So, for example, $\Phi^{-1}(0.975) = 1.96$. In R, we can evaluate the inverse of $\Phi$ using the `qnorm` function.
```{r}
qnorm(0.975)
```
Note that these calculations are for the standard normal distribution by default (mean = 0, standard deviation = 1), but we can also define these for any normal distribution. We can do this using the `mean` and `sd` arguments in the `pnorm` and `qnorm` function. For example, we can use `qnorm` to determine quantiles of a distribution with a specific average and standard deviation
```{r}
qnorm(0.975, mean = 5, sd = 2)
```
For the normal distribution, all the calculations related to quantiles are done without data, thus the name <em>theoretical quantiles</em>. But quantiles can be defined for any distribution, including an empirical one. So if we have data in a vector $x$, we can define the quantile associated with any proportion $p$ as the $q$ for which the proportion of values below $q$ is $p$. Using R code, we can define q as the value for which `mean(x <= q) = p`. Notice that not all $p$ have a $q$ for which the proportion is exactly $p$. There are several ways of defining the best $q$ as discussed in the help for the `quantile` function.

To give a quick example, for the male heights data, we have that:
```{r}
mean(x <= 69.5)
```
So about 50% are shorter or equal to 69 inches. This implies that if  
$p=0.50$ then $q=69.5$.

The idea of a QQ-plot is that if your data is well approximated by normal distribution then the quantiles of your data should be similar to the quantiles of a normal distribution. To construct a QQ-plot, we do the following:

1. Define a vector of $m$ proportions $p_1, p_2, \dots, p_m$.
2. Define a vector of quantiles $q_1, \dots, q_m$ for your data for the proportions $p_1, \dots, p_m$. We refer to these as the <em>sample quantiles</em>.
3. Define a vector of theoretical quantiles for the proportions $p_1, \dots, p_m$ for a normal distribution with the same average and standard deviation as the data.
4. Plot the sample quantiles versus the theoretical quantiles.

Let’s construct a QQ-plot using R code. Start by defining the vector of proportions.
```{r}
p <- seq(0.05, 0.95, 0.05)
```
To obtain the quantiles from the data, we can use the `quantile` function like this:
```{r}
sample_quantiles <- quantile(x, p)
```
To obtain the theoretical normal distribution quantiles with the corresponding average and SD, we use the `qnorm` function:
```{r}
theoretical_quantiles <- qnorm(p, mean = mean(x), sd = sd(x))
```
To see if they match or not, we plot them against each other and draw the identity line:
```{r}
install.packages(qpplot)
qplot(theoretical_quantiles, sample_quantiles) + geom_abline()
```
Notice that this code becomes much cleaner if we use standard units:
```{r}
sample_quantiles <- quantile(z, p)
theoretical_quantiles <- qnorm(p) 
qplot(theoretical_quantiles, sample_quantiles) + geom_abline()
```
The above code is included to help describe QQ-plots. However, in practice it is easier to use the **ggplot2** code described in Section [8.16](https://rafalab.github.io/dsbook/distributions.html#other-geometries):
```{r}
heights %>% filter(sex == "Male") %>%
  ggplot(aes(sample = scale(height))) + 
  geom_qq() +
  geom_abline()
```
While for the illustration above we used 20 quantiles, the default from the `geom_qq` function is to use as many quantiles as data points.

## **8.11 Percentiles**

Before we move on, let’s define some terms that are commonly used in exploratory data analysis.

<em>Percentiles</em> are special cases of quantiles that are commonly used. The percentiles are the quantiles you obtain when setting the $p$ at $0.01, 0.02, ..., 0.99$. We call, for example, the case of $p=0.25$ the 25th percentile, which gives us a number for which 25% of the data is below. The most famous percentile is the 50th, also known as the <em>median</em>.

For the normal distribution the <em>median</em> and average are the same, but this is generally not the case.

Another special case that receives a name are the <em>quartiles</em>, which are obtained when setting $p=0.25,0.50,$ and $0.75$.

## **8.12 Boxplots**

To introduce boxplots we will go back to the US murder data. Suppose we want to summarize the murder rate distribution. Using the data visualization technique we have learned, we can quickly see that the normal approximation does not apply here:

![](https://rafalab.github.io/dsbook/book_files/figure-html/hist-qqplot-non-normal-data-1.png)

In this case, the histogram above or a smooth density plot would serve as a relatively succinct summary.

Now suppose those used to receiving just two numbers as summaries ask us for a more compact numerical summary.

Here Tukey offered some advice. Provide a five-number summary composed of the range along with the quartiles (the 25th, 50th, and 75th percentiles). Tukey further suggested that we ignore <em>outliers</em> when computing the range and instead plot these as independent points. We provide a detailed explanation of outliers later. Finally, he suggested we plot these numbers as a “box” with “whiskers” like this:

with the box defined by the 25% and 75% percentile and the whiskers showing the range. The distance between these two is called the <em>interquartile</em> range. The two points are outliers according to Tukey’s definition. The median is shown with a horizontal line. Today, we call these <em>boxplots</em>.

From just this simple plot, we know that the median is about 2.5, that the distribution is not symmetric, and that the range is 0 to 5 for the great majority of states with two exceptions.

We discuss how to make boxplots in Section [8.16](https://rafalab.github.io/dsbook/distributions.html#other-geometries).
